# terraform-azure-linux-vm

terraform azure-linux-vm collection.

- [completed/](completed/) unable to make it work.
- [terraform-cloudinit/](terraform-cloudinit/) Terraform + Azure + cloud-init just wonâ€™t work
- [az-cloud-init/](az-cloud-init/) cloud-init directly with `az` cli works perfectly
- [terraform-cloud-init/](terraform-cloud-init/) AOK finally!!! *Update*: That's only a short-lived success -- works only with (out-dated) UbuntuServer 18.04-LTS but not latest debian-11!
- There is also [terraform-examples: terraform-provider-azure](https://github.com/brokedba/terraform-examples/tree/master/terraform-provider-azure) but I've lost the interest to try more, as the experiences had been frustration after frustration...
